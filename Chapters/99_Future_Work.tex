Our study focused on finding a generic algorithm which allows for large-scale detection of drive-by downloads. Currently, the analysis phase is done after processing the events and creating the graph. Real-time analysis on the graph would allow for faster detection and reporting but might have more overhead. The optimal time to analyze a graph should be investigated.\\

During the proof of concept, an abstraction was made from low-level API calls to high-level events. While this greatly reduces the effort needed to analyze the graph, this poses a risk that crucial information might be missed. Further effort should be invested in finding an optimal granularity for the graph.

% Alles over de implementatie van het algoritme boeit niet, dat is niet waarover onze paper gaat
% detecting malware/drive-by downloads is dus niet echt future work
