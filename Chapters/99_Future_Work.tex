Our study focused on finding a generic algorithm which allows for large-scale detection of drive-by downloads. Currently, the analysis phase is done after processing the events and creating the graph. Real-time analysis on the graph would allow for faster detection and reporting but might have more overhead. The optimal time to analyse a graph should be investigated.

During the proof of concept, an abstraction was made from low-level API calls to high-level events. While this greatly reduces the effort needed to analyse the graph, this poses a risk that crucial information might be missed. Further effort should be invested in finding an optimal granularity for the graph.

Further intellectual effort should also be invested in the defining of relations between events. In our proof of concept, the relations between events are simplistic and straightforward. With more effort, better and more complex relations can be found and defined in the graph.

% Alles over de implementatie van het algoritme boeit niet, dat is niet waarover onze paper gaat
% detecting malware/drive-by downloads is dus niet echt future work
