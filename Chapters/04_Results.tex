This section discusses the implementation of the algorithm, the problems encountered and a comparison with the latest Cuckoo version.

\subsection{Implementing the algorithm}

What follows is a short overview of how the algorithm was implemented, the actual code can be found on GitHub\footnote{\url{https://github.com/MartijnB/cuckoo/tree/multi-url}}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Visit} To support the parallel visiting of URLs in one virtual machine, Cuckoo had to be extended. Support for this was added using tabs, but this left us with a problem to detect when a new URL was feeded to a tab (see \ref{99problems}). To solve this problem, every URL in this PoC is now opened in its own window.

\item \textbf{Process} In this step, the API calls were bundled into ten different events before being added to the graph. If no relation was found between an event and a previous event, an edge was created between the event itself and the event which represents the browser context. The HTTP `Referer' header was used to find relations between HTTP events, essentially creating a referer tree\cite{qui}. \todo{Discuss all relations here?}

\item \textbf{Analyse} To implement the analysis phase of the algorithm, a simple analyser was written that detects process spawns below browsing contexts. Appendix A shows pseudo code of the analyser.

\item \textbf{Report} Reporting is done on the commandline but generated graphs of anomalities are saved to the disk in the folder structure of Cuckoo.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Opening a new URL in the same browser context} was not detectable by the monitored API calls. On top of that, processes were reused when a browsing context was closed and a new one was opened, this made it essentially the same as reusing the browsing context. Internet Explorer also behaves differently when interacting with the automation interface (COM) compared to real user interaction, leaving us without certain registry values that could be used to detect the opening of a new URL. Therefor we decided to use a new Internet Explorer process for each URL which gives us a process ID per browser context.

\textbf{Working with JSON} was extremely slow in Cuckoo. After the virtual machine has done its work, BSON files are transferred to the host machine. These BSON files are then parsed by Cuckoo and analysed after which a JSON file is written. Our \texttt{mass-analyse.py} depended on this JSON, which made it very slow to use. A BSON parser was written to skip the whole JSON step and thus we were able to work earlier on the data, giving us a dramatic speedup.

\subsection{Running the PoC}

Running the proof of concept is as simple as running Cuckoo and running our Python script. Listing \ref{code:run} shows how the PoC is run. As explained in section \ref{sec:setup} the URL list contains the Top 20 most visited websites and some malware websites. Figure \ref{fig:graph} shows the full graph created in the process phase. Notice the red dots in the top left corner of the graph which indicate process spawns and the purple dots which indicate shell command executions. The analyser run in phase 3 succesfully found this anomality and reports it back to the user. A graph of the browsing context in which this anomality occured is also shown to the user, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:subgraph}.

\subsection{Comparison with other malware analysis systems}

To quantify the improvement that was made, several benchmarks were run against our improved version. Those benchmarks were compared with a development version of Cuckoo 1.2\footnote{\url{https://github.com/cuckoobox/cuckoo/commit/6177071cfd57500fbf1dc17a66f5aff39051c75e}} and Anubis\footnote{\url{http://anubis.iseclab.org/?action=advanced\_form}}, two malware analysis systems which visit URLs sequentially.% The development version of Cuckoo was also used as the base for our development.<-- dit is niet de goeie plaats om dat te zeggen....

The benchmark, for the unmodified Cuckoo, consists of provisioning Cuckoo with one or more URLs until Cuckoo changes the status to ``reported''. Because the adapted version does not have this status, the benchmark for this version of Cuckoo stops when the \texttt{mass-analyse.py} script exits. Anubis reports contain a parameter called ``time needed'' which was used as the benchmark time.

Benchmarks were executed with 1, 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 URLs and each benchmark was run 25 times to filter out anomalities.

Table \ref{tbl:results} shows the summary\footnote{The raw numbers used to generate the table and graphs can be found in Appendix B.} of the benchmarks. This table gives the mean over all 25 runs given \textit{X} URLs for the unmodified and modified Cuckoo respectively. It then makes a comparison between the execution time of those two versions. As can be seen from the table, for 1 URL there is already an improvement of 313\% and for more than 10 URLs, our version is at least ten times as fast.

Figure \ref{fig:chart-box} and figure \ref{fig:chart-trend} show these numbers in a different way. Figure \ref{fig:chart-box} shows a boxplot which compares the boxplot of the reference version with our modified version.\todo{Meer uitleg maar we hebben nog niet alle data} Figure \ref{fig:chart-trend} shows an interpolation and extrapolation of the results.
