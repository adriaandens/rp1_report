In the coming chapter will the results of the research project be presented. First, will be diven into the architecture of web browsers. This will mostly be about the different process models and network stacks of the populair browsers. This was a prerequisite for the design and development of our algorithm that will be described in the second part of this chapter. In the last part of this chapter will be focussed on the results of the implemention and usage of the algorithm to detect real malware \todo{Better description} in a fast and reliable way.
