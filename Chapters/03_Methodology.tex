%\item Which techniques are used by browsers to make concurrently visiting multiple URLs possible?
%\item Which APIs are used by web browsers to make HTTP requests and retrieve webpages?
%\item How can we link an HTTP request to its source URL without the modification of the used web browser?
%\item What extra information from the client's (running) machine can be used to augment the information gained from network traffic to make the tracking of malware to its source URL easier?

Now the outline of this project has been set, it has become time to look how the research questions can be answered.
