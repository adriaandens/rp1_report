For a better insight into the project, it is necessary to introduce certain theoretical concepts first. In the next chapter this theory will be used to base the approach on for the design and development of the algorithm and choices regarding the proof of concept.

\subsection{Drive-by downloads}

Browsing the internet with an unpatched system, for example because the patch is not installed or there is simply no solution available, can be dangerous. All software contains mistakes and such mistakes are patched almost on a daily basis. Part of those mistakes can be (ab)used to get control over a computer system and be used to run malicious software without the user noticing.

If a website uses such mistake to take control over the web browser and download malicious software to the system, this is called a drive-by download\cite{Le2013}. Figure \ref{fig:dbdownload} shows the steps involved from visiting a website until the moment the system is infected with malware.

By compromising the web browser and injecting malicious code, the malware gets full control over the infected process, running with the same privileges as the web browser on the host system. Depending on the system configuration this either means that full system access is available or that additional steps are required to escalate the privileges to the intended level.

\subsubsection{Behaviour}
\label{sec:behavior}

What happens after a malware infection depends on the malware and the goals of the attacker. But usually the goals of the attacker are persistence and further exploitation. The former is achieved by writing executable code to the disk and optionally changing several configuration files to make sure the code is executed at certain events, for example after reboot. The latter is achieved by dowloading further malicious components. We thus expect to see extra network traffic after the first exploit.

While theoretically malware could directly communicate with the kernel, most malware\todo{need citation} behaves like a normal application and uses the installed, or with the operating system provided, libraries. The usage of such libraries can be detected when the access to them is monitored.

\subsection{API analysis}

In the early days, libraries were primarily used by an application by statically linking to it. This means that the library becomes part of the application and it is no longer possible to determine which part of the application was originally part of the used libraries.

For performance and maintainability, dynamic linking was invented. The application describes which libraries it needs and the linker of the operating system will glue the applications and its dependent libraries together in the memory space of the application. 

Because the linker has to know all exported functions and where in the library it can find such function, a symbol table is part of every dynamic library. The same information can be used to hook into an provided function during runtime or to trick the linker to load a replacement of a certain function because the modified version has a higher priority.

This is called API hooking\cite{} and it is a very useful technique to monitor the behaviour of applications. The original function is replaced by a substitute. This substitute function calls, for example, the original function and logs the performed operation or \todo{change sentence} is a custom replacement of the original function.

The technical implementation of API hooking is highly complex and platform specific. Many different techniques\cite{jbremer2012} of hooking are possible as well. If the start of the application can be controlled, the linker search path can be extended to include the replacement library. Alternatively, the import section of the application can be modified. When the application is already loaded or modification of the application or system is unwanted, the function to hook can be overwritten in memory with a replacement or jump to a different location in memory. However, this will prevent the ability to execute the original function unless the overwritten bytes are carefully preserved and reconstructed somewhere else.

In this project API hooking will be used to reverse engineer the internal workings and API usage of web browsers and to log the behaviour of malware for later analysis.
