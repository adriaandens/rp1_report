For a better insight into the project, it is necessary to introduce certain theoretical concepts first. The next section will use this theory as a basis for the design and development of the algorithm.

\subsection{Drive-by downloads}

Browsing the Internet with an unpatched system can be dangerous. Software contains mistakes and fixes for these mistakes are released on a daily basis. Part of those mistakes can be (ab)used to get control over a computer system and be used to run malicious software. Such mistakes are called vulnerabilities.

If such a vulnerability is used to take control of the web browser (or one of its plug-ins like Flash or Java) and malicious software is downloaded to the system then this is called a drive-by download \cite{Le2013}. Figure \ref{fig:dbdownload} shows the steps involved from visiting a website to the moment the system is infected with malware.

By compromising the web browser and injecting malicious code (called exploitation), the malware gets full control over the infected process, running with the same privileges as the web browser on the host system. Depending on the system configuration this either means that the system is now under the control of the attacker or that additional steps are required to escalate the privileges to the intended level.

\subsubsection{Behaviour}
\label{sec:behavior}

What happens after a malware infection depends on the malware and the goals of the attacker. Common goals are persistence of the malware and further exploitation. The former is achieved by writing executable code to the disk and optionally changing several configuration files to make sure the code is executed at certain events, for example after rebooting. The latter is achieved by dowloading further malicious components for the next stage. %We thus expect to see file system operations and additional network traffic after the first exploit.

While some malware communicates directly with the kernel (via so-called system calls), most malware \cite{MaliciousAPIs} behaves like a normal application and uses the installed, or with the operating system provided, libraries. The usage of such libraries can be detected when the access to them is monitored.

A special class of malware \cite{ZeroAccess,Gameover} is formed by those that infiltrate the operating system kernel by loading malicious drivers. Such kernel malware is usually used as part of a rootkit and is very hard to detect and analyse as it runs with the highest possible privileges. From the moment the driver is loaded, it is able to hide itself, files, network connections and other applications from the user and normal applications.

\subsection{Libraries and APIs}

Libraries contain reusable parts of code to make the development of applications easier. Applications use them so the developer does not have to worry about the low-level details of the used system. The application programming interface (API) defines the exposed interface of the library with the functions that can be used.

In the early days, libraries were primarily used by an application by statically linking to it. This means that the library becomes part of the application and it is no longer possible to determine which part of the application was originally part of the used libraries.

For size reduction and maintainability, dynamic linking was invented. The application describes which libraries it needs and the linker of the operating system will glue the applications and its dependent libraries (which are defined in the import section of the application) together in the memory space of the application. This happens at runtime. 

Because the linker has to know all exported functions and their location, a symbol table is part of every dynamic library. The same information can be used to hook into a function during runtime or to trick the linker in loading a replacement for a function. This is called API hooking \cite{APIHookingRevealed}.

\subsubsection{API hooking}

API hooking is a widely used technique to monitor or change the behaviour of applications. With API hooking the original function is replaced by a substitute (or hook). This substitute function, for example, first logs the performed operation and then calls the original function. Or the substitute could be a custom replacement of the original function.

The technical implementation of API hooking is highly complex and platform specific. Many different techniques \cite{jbremer2012} of hooking are possible as well. If the start of the application can be controlled, the linker search path can be extended to include the replacement library. Alternatively, the import section of the application can be modified. When the application is already loaded or the modification of the application or system is undesired, the function to be hooked can be overwritten in memory with a replacement or a jump to a different location in memory as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:apihooking}. However, this will prevent the ability to execute the original function unless the overwritten bytes are carefully preserved and reconstructed somewhere else, a so-called trampoline.

\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[width=14.7cm]{Images/API-hooking.png}
    \caption{Example of how an API function can be hooked at runtime by overwriting the first bytes with a jump to a substitute function. If the original function has to be preserved, a trampoline is added which consists of the overwritten bytes of the original function. \cite{APIHookImage}}
    \label{fig:apihooking}
\end{figure}

% In this project, API hooking will be used to reverse engineer the internal workings and API usage of web browsers and to log the behaviour of the web browser and malware for later analysis.

%\subsubsection{Alternatives}

%API hooking provides an interface between an application and its environment. While this gives a nearly complete insight in the behaviour of an application, it is detectable and could also result in too much information to handle efficently. In some cases the same or similar information can also be gained with more passive approaches.

%Network traffic and HTTP requests can be monitored by sniffing the network interface or intercepting it on, for example, the gateway.
