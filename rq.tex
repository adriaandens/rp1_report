In cooperation with the Dutch National Cyber Security Center (NCSC-NL), our research project will focus on the question:\\

\textit{How can we concurrently visit multiple URLs and still be able to determine which URL was responsible for malicious activities?}\\
\newpage
To answer the research question, multiple subquestions have been formulated:
\begin{itemize}
\item Which techniques are used by browsers to make concurrently visiting multiple URLs possible?
\item How can we link an HTTP request to its source URL without the modification of the used web browser?
\item Which APIs are used by web browsers to make HTTP requests and retrieve webpages?
\item What extra information from the client's (running) machine can be used to augment the information gained from network traffic to make the tracking of malware to its source URL easier?
\end{itemize}
